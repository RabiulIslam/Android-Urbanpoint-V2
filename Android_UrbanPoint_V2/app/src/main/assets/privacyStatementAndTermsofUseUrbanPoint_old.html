<h2 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; text-decoration:underline;">Terms of Use</h2>


<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">Urban Point provides this app subject to the terms of use below and the privacy statement presented above. Your use of the app is subject to you accepting those terms.</p>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"> Purpose of the app </p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">The purpose of the app is to enable users of the app to access product or service offers or other information from third party merchants (Merchant Offers). Merchant Offers are negotiated between Urban Point and the merchants, and their offers are presented to the paying users of the Urban Point mobile app. </p>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"> Who can use the app </p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">The app is available for use by anybody in Qatar aged 13 or over. If you are under 13, you must not use this app. If you are not in Qatar, you can use it, but probably won't get much out of doing so – as all of the Merchant Offers are specific to particular parts of Qatar. </p>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Merchants responsible for the Merchant Offers  </p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">Information about Merchant Offers is not a recommendation or statement of opinion by Urban Point in relation to a particular product, service or third party provider and is not intended to be investment, financial product, legal, taxation or other advice by Urban Point. </p>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">Merchant Offers are not provided or endorsed by Urban Point. Your use of Merchant Offers will be on the terms agreed between you and the relevant third party supplier.

Urban Point has no liability or responsibility to you for any of the goods or services which are the subject of any Merchant Offer. </p>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">Urban Point may receive fees and/or commissions from third parties for Merchant Offers Content. You acknowledge and consent to Urban Point receiving those fees. </p>



<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Privacy  </p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Location information required  </p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">In order to provide you with offers that are relevant to where you are, the app requires that you provide it with information about the location of your device. At present, it does so using the GPS location functionality in your device. </p>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">If you do not agree to the app accessing that location information, or turn off the GPS functionality in your device, the app may not be able to provide you with offers which are applicable to your location, or may present you with offers which are not available at your location. </p>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">App and Merchant Offer performance tracking  </p>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">The app uses mobile app performance tracking functionality provided by Tune Inc to a monitor the performance of the app and Merchant Offers in the app, and to identify any potential performance issues with the app or those Merchant Offers. To do so, the app may from time to time send app performance information, device information and app usage data to Tune Inc, who hold that information on our behalf. For more information about Tune Inc, visit them at <a href="">http://www.tune.com/ </a> </p>



<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"> Downloading and using the app may incur data charge </p>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">As the app is not unmetered, you may incur data charges when you download or use the app from your handset. Whether or not you incur data charges will depend upon your mobile service plan. </p>



<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">App provided "as is"  </p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;">This app is provided "as is". While Urban Point will use reasonable care in providing the app to you, Urban Point can't guarantee that the app will always be free from faults.
